Change Log
==========
PageEdit-0.9.5
  New Features
     - add the ability to pass all xhtml files in the spine in Reading Order to PageEdit 
            via opening the OPF.  Allow quick file navigation via navigation menu and next 
            and previous arrows keys.

     - add a Edit vs Preview mode toggle icon that will allow links among xhtmls files in the spine
            to be active and work (in Mode: Preview)

     - installed a QtMessage handler to create a debug log file controlled via a
          PAGEEDIT_DEBUG_LOGFILE environment setting, to simplify user bug issue feedback

  Bug Fixes
     - fix macOS specific launch bugs due to bug in canonical files and timing of Apple events
     - make sure jQuery is loaded before trying to manipulate a file by imporving web load sequence
     - use GetEnvironmentVar to uniformly access Environment Vars in a cross platform manner
     - disable prev and next navigation buttons when only one input xhtml file exists

     - allow cleanup after paste from  Word during Save using
